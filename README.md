# Baytop
 Inkscape extension that creates a shape like that of the roof of a bay window

Given a set of parameters for two truncated polygons, this program generates paper models of (1) a top (2) a bottom (3) a back and (4) a side represented by a strip with tabs and score lines; and a side wrapper for decorative paper that omits the tabs.

Installing:

Copy Baytop.inx and Baytop.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory.

Usage:

See the file How_to_use_the_baytop_extension.pdf for details on use

Note:

This extension (for Inkscape version 1.1.) is functional, but not bulletproof, so be mindful of the input constraints in the usage document. At this time it appears to be functional in the development version of Inkscape 1.2 as well.
